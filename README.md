I am a composer/computer scientist with a background in sound design, music composision and artificial intelligence. I defended my Ph.D. dissertation in Music Information Retrieval titled [Computational Modelling of Variance in Musical Harmony](https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/380443) at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University) in 2019. My PhD was supervised by [dr. Anja Volk](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~fleis102/) and [prof. dr. Remco C. Veltkamp](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~veltk101/).

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at [RTL Netherlands](https://github.com/rtlnl), working on AI audiovisual projects for television and video on demand, such as automatic trailer generation, thumbnail picking, and music detection.
